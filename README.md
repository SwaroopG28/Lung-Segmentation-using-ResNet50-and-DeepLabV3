# Lung Segmentation using ResNet50 and DeepLabV3

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **deep learning-based lung segmentation system** using **ResNet50** as a feature extractor and **DeepLabV3** for semantic segmentation. The model is designed to accurately extract lung regions from medical chest X-ray images, aiding in medical image analysis.

## Key Features
- Utilizes **ResNet50** as the backbone for feature extraction to leverage pre-trained deep learning models.
- Implements **DeepLabV3** architecture for precise segmentation of lung areas.
- Includes **preprocessing** techniques such as image resizing and normalization to enhance training and segmentation results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for development and scripting.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the deep learning models.
- **OpenCV** and **NumPy** for image processing and manipulation.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a robust segmentation model that can be used for medical imaging tasks, specifically for detecting and outlining lung regions in chest X-rays.
